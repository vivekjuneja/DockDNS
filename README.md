**DockDNS for Boot2Docker**

***Background***

DockDNS is simple and effective. However, it assumes the Docker Daemon runs on Non-TLS mode. I needed this to support TLS, and hence work out of the box for Boot2Docker (Mac / Win) based systems. Moreover, container names generated by FIG usually do not comply with DNS Naming convention. I needed to support alternate DNS resolution for these type of container names


Making changes to add the following support :-

1. Support Boot2Docker TLS Endpoint of Docker REST API

2. Optimization for improving performance of DNS queries

3. More Logging

4. Error Handling

5. Added support for resolving Container names generated by Fig into a DNS Friendly name 

6. Added a sample Fig Application that used DockerDNS
